Рука ярости

Группа не очень дружелюбных приключенцев с Побережья Мечей, называющих себя [Рука ярости] имеют тенденцию к грабежу и насилию по отношению к людям, которых встречают по пути. После путишествия в Лускан с группой пиратов их запланированая экспедиция с командой с треском провалилась. Оказавшись в Таргосе они решили испытать удачу в качестве наемников, посланых на помощь Таргосу. Имя для группы придумал их лидер-тиран Макадос.

Makados, a proud Stormlord of Talos, is an intimidating, charismatic figure. Though he is a priest, he is perfectly fit for front-line battle.  This is good, since Makados usually picks fights with people the party encounters.
Dahel Bloody-Four, a barbarian from the Western Heartlands, is even more bloodthirsty than Makados. Though he's a bit dim and not particularly strong for a barbarian, his speed and incredible endurance make him a dangerous opponent. He earned his nickname from a barfight where he killed four combatants out of sheer malice after he had already beat them into unconsciousness.
The dispossessed elven noble, Amraith, is a cool and efficient warrior.  Quicker than anyone else in the Hands of Fury, he is often the last one standing at the end of their "disputes".  He also has a quick mind, making him a bit more versatile than simple Dahel.  Mirai Wainwright is the lone woman in the Hands of Fury, but her position as the party's only arcane spellcaster makes her quite valuable.  A half-elf, she does not have the terrific speed of Amraith, but nor does she suffer his frailty.  She is quite intelligent, strong-willed, and surprisingly, physically strong.  The other dispossessed outcast in the party, Harbesh Carver, is a capable dwarven rogue and all-around thug.  Strong, smart, and tough, he leaves discussion to Makados and the others.  He is a grumpy individual who warms up more to a difficult lock than a friendly stranger.  The last member of the group, Fissera, is an angry, aggressive druid who makes a terrible companion for Makados.  Wise and profound in all the worst ways, Fissera waits for Makados to give the signal, then unleashes nature's worst wrath on anyone who stands in their way.  Unlike Makados and the rest of the "front-line", Fissera does not consider himself particularly well-suited for front-line combat.
